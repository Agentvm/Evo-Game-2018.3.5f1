  --- ToDo -----------------------------
  
 - Use Interface IDisplayable to make Objects displayable, then change InfoTag to display their content
 - Make a fancy genom viewer

 - Generalize Functions in IntensityFunctionCollection
 - Let every Charakter have a second, "preferences" genom, that can be altered aswell. This is used to evolve feeding and wandering routines.
 - When growing, the Collider must grow with the Plant
 - Juvenile Problem (start at 1/10 maxSize, then progress with each game tick)
 - (check) Color Problem (Color Genom should mirror certain genes of the main Genom)
 - Use Instantiate instead of FindObjectsWithTag
 - Debug GameVariables.getTraits // Warning does never fire
 - scaling thoughts

 --- Verbesserungen -----------------------------
 
 - Make a Lerp Version or -Option of SlerpCoroutine
 - (check, fair enough) fix camera scrolling movement
 - Genome Convenience Functions for adding multiple interwoven traits

  --- Ideas -----------------------------
 
 - Make Evolutionary Algorithm that recombines and mutates Genomes
 - (check) Use Delegates to make Character Abilities work
