  --- ToDo -----------------------------

 - Genome implement addTraitStructure
 - Use Interface IDisplayable to make Objects displayable, then change InfoTag to display their content
 - Let every Charakter have a second, "appearance" genom, that is composed of random genes of the main genome. This marks the color of the individual.


 --- Verbesserungen -----------------------------
 
 - Make a Lerp Version or -Option of SlerpCoroutine
 - fix camera scrolling movement

  --- Ideas -----------------------------
 
 - Make Evolutionary Algorithm that recombines and mutates Genomes
 - Use Delegates to make Character Abilities work
