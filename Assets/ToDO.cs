  --- ToDo -----------------------------

 - Genome implement addTraitStructure
 - Use Interface IDisplayable to make Objects displayable, then change InfoTag to display their content
 - Let every Charakter have a second, "appearance" genom, that is composed of random genes of the main genome. This marks the color of the individual.
 - When growing, the Collider must grow with the Plan
 - Juvenile Problem (start at 1/10 maxSize, then progress with each game tick)
 - Color Problem (Color Genom should mirror certain genes of the main Genom)

 --- Verbesserungen -----------------------------
 
 - Make a Lerp Version or -Option of SlerpCoroutine
 - fix camera scrolling movement
 - Genome Convenience Functions for adding multiple interwoven traits

  --- Ideas -----------------------------
 
 - Make Evolutionary Algorithm that recombines and mutates Genomes
 - Use Delegates to make Character Abilities work
